#### Note
* m is sample size which is splited by K knots between 1 and endpoint e. 
 Note that K is the number of knots (number of rows) you set in sidebar, 
 and e is the endpoint sample size for extrapolation; default K is 40 and e is double reference sample size.
* Sm is the estimated rarefaction/prediction richness function with sample size m
* Cm is the estimated rarefaction/prediction sample coverage function with sample size m
* Sm.LCL and Sm.UCL is 95% bootstrap confidence lower and upper limits for Sm
* Cm.LCL and Cm.UCL is 95% bootstrap confidence lower and upper limits for Cm
