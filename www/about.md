About
-------------------------

The program iNEXT (iNterpolation and EXTrapolation) is written in the R language. The user provides a vector of abundances of individual species (abundance-based). iNEXT computes the following species richness estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals:

1. Sample-size-based rarefaction and extrapolation: species richness estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples up to double the original sample size (= the reference sample size). Refer to Colwell et al. (2012) for details.

2. Coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation: species richness estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples for coverage of up to double the reference sample size. Refer to Chao and Jost (2012) for details.

Program iNEXT also plots the following three integrated sampling curves suggested in Chao et al. (2013) for unified sampling and estimation in biodiversity studies.

1. Sample-size-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curve: species richness estimates for a rarefied and extrapolated sample with sample size up to double the reference sample size.

2. Sample completeness curve: sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage) with respect to sample size. This curve provides a bridge between sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation.

3. Coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curve: species richness estimates for rarefied sample and extrapolated sample with sample coverage up to double the reference sample size.


- The two individual-based abundance data sets (Oldgrowth and Secondgrowth) for demonstration in iNEXT are taken from Janzen (1973a, b):
  * Janzen, D. H. 1973a. Sweep samples of tropical foliage insects: effects of seasons, vegetation types, elevation, time of day, and insularity. Ecology 54:687-708.
  
  * Janzen, D. H. 1973b. Sweep samples of tropical foliage insects: description of study sites, with data on species abundances and size distributions. Ecology 54:659-686.

- The three sample-based incidence data sets (Berlese, Malaise and fogging) for demonstration in iNEXT are taken from Longino et al. (2002):
  * Longino, J. T., J. Coddington, and R. K. Colwell. 2002. The ant fauna of a tropical rain forest: estimating species richness three different ways. Ecology 83:689-702.
